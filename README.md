# CODTECH_task-2_REST-API-CLIENT
## Project Overview
The REST API Client is a Java-based application designed to consume public REST APIs, fetch real-time data, and present it in a structured format. This project was developed as part of the CODTECH Internship Task 2, requiring the implementation of an HTTP-based API client capable of handling JSON responses efficiently.

The primary objective of this project is to retrieve and parse data from external web services, such as weather updates, user details, or other publicly available datasets. The application was built and executed in IntelliJ IDEA, ensuring a smooth development workflow with proper error handling and structured output formatting.
